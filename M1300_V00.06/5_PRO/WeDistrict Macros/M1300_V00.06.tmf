M1300 macro represents a thermal solar system under WeSSun technology, which consists of the incorporation of mobile reflectors to a thermal solar collector, whichever may be a Flat Plate Collector, an Evacuated Tube Collector or an Evacuated Tube Compound Parabolic Collector technology. Hence M1300 macro represents a solar thermal collector and its movable one or two reflectors that result in a larger opening area.
Byaxial asymetrical IAM are neede in order to charaterize this larger area for different sun positions refered to the collector aperture area.
On the other hand, this macro considers a primary loop in which there is a heat transfer fluid, which receives thermal energy captured by collectors, and transfers to a secondary circuit throughout a counter-current heat exchanger.
The output of the secondary loop, which corresponds to the output of heat exchanger, is precisely the output of M1300 macro. Likewise, the input to this loop, which corresponds to the input of heat exchanger, is one of the inputs of the macro, and is associated with a thermal storage system, which in this case is not part of this macro and belongs to another macro (M2100 or other possible connections).
From the other side, there is the other main macro input, which is associated with the meteorological data provided by meteorological macro (M0100 for instance). Such as the macro considers shading effects, before this data is entered as input to the solar thermal collector system, it enters two types, which have the purpose of considering the shading generated by obstacles present on the horizon, and the shading generated by the same collector arrangement. The output of these types is shaded radiation, which enters as an input to the collector type. For simulation of operation of the solar thermal system, there is a multiple-choice control system within macro (match flow or fixed flow rate) that supervises the correct operation, and which decides when it is possible to enter operation, which occurs when two conditions are met: when there is demand and when there is a solar resource available.
For more detailed description refer to de Manual.
